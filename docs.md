# Alegra Type C Invoice Generator

## Project Overview

This application is a lightweight internal tool that allows the client to recreate existing Alegra invoices as **Type C** invoices.

Instead of importing invoices from Excel, the application connects directly to the Alegra account via API, fetches existing invoices, allows the user to select which invoices should be recreated, and generates new Type C invoices using the appropriate Number Template.

The UI strictly replicates the native Alegra Sales Invoice page to minimize the learning curve.

---

# Primary Goal

Convert existing Type B invoices into Type C invoices.

The application **does not modify** existing invoices.

Instead it:

* Fetches existing invoices via API
* Lets the user select which invoices to recreate
* Reads client/item data from selected invoices and directly generates new Type C invoices
* Exports the generated invoices in the same format provided by Alegra

# Features

## Phase 1 — Authentication

### Goal

Authenticate the user with Alegra.

The application should require:

* Username (Email)
* API Token / Password

After successful authentication:

* Verify credentials
* Store session securely
* Load invoices

Status

* [x] Completed

---

## Phase 2 — Fetch Sales Invoices, Table Display & Row Selection

### Goal

Retrieve invoices directly from Alegra and display them using a Shadcn/TanStack Data Table styled identically to native Alegra UI, enabling multi-row selection.

Columns

* **Select Checkbox** (Select All & Individual selection)
* **Type** (Derived from `subDocumentType`, e.g., `INVOICE_C` $\rightarrow$ `C`)
* **Number** (`numberTemplate.fullNumber` or `number`)
* **Client** (`client.name`)
* **Creation** (`date`)
* **Expiration** (`dueDate`, with past-due red styling)
* **Total** (`total`, formatted currency)
* **To be charged** (`balance`, formatted currency)
* **Status** (`open` $\rightarrow$ Pending, `draft` $\rightarrow$ Draft, `closed` $\rightarrow$ Paid, `void` $\rightarrow$ Void)
* **Actions** (Contextual row buttons)

Features

* Client-side search filtering by Client Name
* Full native Alegra color palette, badges, icons, and layout structure
* Multi-row select with counter and batch action trigger

Status

* [x] Completed

---

## Phase 3 — Selection & Type C Generation

### Goal

Allow the user to decide which invoices should be recreated. Only the selected invoices should be recreated.


Read data directly from selected existing invoices and immediately create corresponding **Type C** invoices.

Since data is pulled directly from the live Alegra API, client and item IDs are guaranteed to exist, eliminating redundant existence checks.

Workflow

```
Selected Original Invoice
        ↓
Extract Client ID, Items, Prices, Taxes & Dates
        ↓
Apply Type C Number Template
        ↓
POST New Invoice to Alegra API

```

Requirements

* Reuse existing Client ID (zero duplicate contacts)
* Retain original Items, Quantities, Unit Prices, and Taxes
* Retain relevant dates
* Apply Type C Number Template
* PDF download option available per invoice

Status

* [x] Completed

---

## Phase 4 — Generation Summary

### Goal

Display a concise summary immediately after the Type C invoice generation process completes.

The summary only represents the current generation job.

Display

```text
✅ Generation Complete

Successfully created 17 Type C invoices.

Failed: 0

[ Export XLSX ]
[ Download Generation Manifest ]
[ Close ]
```

### Generation Manifest

Alongside the generated invoices, the application creates a machine-readable CSV manifest containing the relationship between every original invoice and its corresponding generated Type C invoice.

The manifest is intended for future automation tasks and serves as a portable mapping file.

Columns

* Original Invoice ID
* Original Invoice Number
* Generated Invoice ID
* Generated Invoice Number
* Client ID
* Client Name
* Generation Status (Success / Failed)
* Error Message (if failed)
* Generated At (Timestamp)

Example

```csv
originalInvoiceId,originalNumber,generatedInvoiceId,generatedNumber,clientId,clientName,status,error,generatedAt
12345,B-001,98765,C-001,456,John Doe,Success,,2026-07-21T10:35:12Z
12346,B-002,98766,C-002,457,Jane Smith,Success,,2026-07-21T10:35:14Z
12347,B-003,,,,,Failed,"Tax condition missing",2026-07-21T10:35:15Z
```

### Purpose

The Generation Manifest enables future automation without requiring a database.

Examples include:

* Bulk deletion of generated Type C invoices.
* Bulk regeneration after fixing failed invoices.
* Auditing original-to-generated invoice relationships.
* Running custom scripts against previously generated invoices.
* Importing the manifest into other internal tools.

Notes

* The manifest is generated for the current execution only.
* The application does not maintain generation history.
* Users should download and retain the manifest if future automation is required.

Status

* [x] Completed

---

## Phase 5 — Export

Export generated invoices matching Alegra's native 32-column `.csv` format (`sep=;` header).

Capabilities
* **Export Selected**: Export checked rows from the data table.
* **Date Range Export**: Fetch and export invoices by start and end dates directly from Alegra.
* **Post-Generation Export**: Instant export of newly created Type C invoices from the summary modal.
* **Line-Item Expansion**: Expands multi-item invoices into individual export rows.

Status

* [x] Completed

---

### Phase 6 — Electronic Invoice Issuance & Emission Status

### Goal

After creating each Type C invoice as a draft, electronically issue (stamp) it so that it becomes AFIP-approved.

Workflow

```text
Create Type C Invoice
        ↓
Collect Created Invoice IDs
        ↓
POST /api/v1/invoices/stamp
(max 10 invoices per request)
        ↓
Emission Status Updated
        ↓
Approved / In Process / Rejected
```

Requirements

- Batch stamp invoices using `POST /invoices/stamp`.
- Process up to 10 invoice IDs per request.
- Handle partial successes and failures.
- Record stamping errors in the generation manifest.
- Only mark generation successful after stamping succeeds.

### Invoice Table Enhancements

Add an **Emission Status** column to the invoice table.

Display values:

- Approved (`STAMPED_AND_ACCEPTED`)
- In process (`STAMPED_AND_WAITING_RESPONSE`)
- Rejected (`STAMPED_AND_REJECTED`)
- To be issued (`PENDING`)
- Not electronic (`NON_ELECTRONIC`)

Status

* [x] Completed
